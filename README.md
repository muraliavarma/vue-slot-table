Unopinionated VueJS table component with highly customizable scoped slots.

# vue-slottable
Unopinionated VueJS table component with highly customizable scoped slots.

## How is this different from other table components?
- Very few table components let you use the power of scoped slots to provide templates for your cells, columns and column headers.
- This component uses `functional` components, meaning that the implementation is very light-weight / high performance.
- This is an unopinionated component. No css assumptions have been made when creating this component. You get to choose your own styling for the table.
- All native table functionalities work as is (transparent wrappers

## Features
- Per column templating and styling
- Column group headers
- Sticky columns

## Installation
`npm install vue-slottable`

    <template slot="column" class="column-1">
      <span slot="header">Foo Header</span>
      <span slot="cell" slot-scope="{ row }">{{row.foo}}</span>
    </template>

<script>
import SlotTable from 'vue-slottable';
export default {
  name: 'MyComponent',
  data() {
    return {
      rows: [{
        foo: 'Foo 1',
        bar: 1,
      }, {
        foo: 'Foo 2',
        bar: 2,
      }],
    };

<style>
.my-table {

.column-1 {
  color: red;
}

.column-2 {
  color: blue;
}
